# Monster Hunter Freedom Unite Upscale Project (english)

**Please note** this is forked from the [main](https://github.com/three5media/mfhu-hd-retexture) project, the one for the US version of the game, with some little fixes for the EU version. Any improvement is welcome.

This is an texture upscaling project for Monster Hunter Freedom Unite ULES01213 (EU version) for the PSP Emulator, [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/).  Please feel free to take anything from this project and use anywhere you like, no credit is due, or help improve this project!

## Description

I'm a README noob so please excuse the mess.  For the most part, this is pretty fresh build.  About 95% of the textures in this project are straight upscales using different models in [Cupscale](https://github.com/n00mkrad/cupscale).  The other 5% of textures were replacements of my own mixed in with some really good UI, area and environment textures from [MHFURemaster-VakSan](https://github.com/Klara-nihk/MHFURemaster-VakSan) and [MHFU-HD](https://github.com/grimmtusk/MHFU-HD), really just an utter fantastic job!!!  The original owner of those textures went far beyond basic upscaling but I wanted a look closer resembling the original game, so I used basic texture upscaling tools for most areas and used others from MHFURemaster-VakSan to make it look nicer.

## Versions

* v2: 7/1/2021 - Project completed as female greatsword user.  All areas and monsters have been retextured.  All female armor and greatsword weapons have been retextured.  Check progress in the progress section.

* v1: 5/5/2021 - Initial Commit

## Download Size and Performance

This is a pretty big retexture project.  The current size is 1.14GB.  This is down from 1.82GB, and while I added a bunch more textures, I ran all textures through a PNG optimizer saving well over 1/2 the space while still maintaining great quality. That's how much space it will take up in your TEXTURES folder.

## Asset Size

Armor, Weapons, Characters and Monsters are all upscaled at 8X original size.  All other assets as 4X original size.

## Progress

I finally unlocked everything at HR9.  Here are my current estimates on where I think the progress is:

* UI: 100% of meaningful elements.  Also replaced PS buttons with X-Box buttons.
* Armor: 100% Female, 85% Male ...these took a VERY long time to do
* Weapons: 100% Greatsword, 95% Other Weapons
* Areas: 100%, this includes the "old" versions of levels, ei: "old desert"
* Characters: 100%
* Monsters: 100% (now using) [MHFURemaster-VakSan](https://github.com/Klara-nihk/MHFURemaster-VakSan) far superior monster textures.

Again, this is all an estimate but seems to be in line with where I am in the game.

### Installing

* Download and extract the "ULES01213" folder in the PSP/TEXTURES folder.
* If the TEXTURES folder does not exist, create it in the same directory where you see the COMMON, GAME, and SAVEDATA folders.
* In the PPSSPP emulator, go to SETTINGS -> TOOLS -> DEVELOPER TOOLS
* Under Texture Replacement, make sure the "Replace textures" box is checked.
* If you device allows, turn on the Post-Processing Shader to FXAA Antialiasing.  This is just a personal preference.

### Help Wanted

I would love for this project to be perfected, so please reach out if you want to be a contributor to this project.
